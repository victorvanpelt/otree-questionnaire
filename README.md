## Questionnaire for oTree

This oTree application is an ex-post questionnaire that can be executed after or before other applications in oTree.
The ex-post questionnaire starts with an introduction page, and ends with a page that includes a few demographic questions.
Between these two pages, the application randomizes all other pages that are added and incorporated in models.py and pages.py under "Survey*.html".
The order of items and questions on every page are also randomized.

I created the application on oTree version 2.0.29, and the application can be tested [here](https://otree-questionnaire.herokuapp.com "here").
