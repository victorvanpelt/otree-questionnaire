## Questionnaire for oTree

This is an ex-post questionnaire that can be executed after or before other applications in oTree.
It starts with an introduction page, and ends with a demographics page.
Between these two pages, the application randomizes other pages included under templates as "Survey*.html" and incorporated in models.py and pages.py.
The order of items and questions on every page are also randomized.

This was created on oTree version 2.0.29, and can be tested [here](https://otree-questionnaire.herokuapp.com "here").
